	        <h1 id="header-history">Our History</h1>  
	        <p class="history-body">101 IT was founded in 2012 by a group of five amateur web developers/programmers who aspired to have an impact on the tech industry. After gaining some experience, they realised that finding job openings in web development including Java and HTML/CSS was an often frustrating and time-consuming process because companies needed to test the skill of job seekers. So, they set out to create a better solution.</p>
	        <p class="history-body">After much hard work and dedication, they finally launched their careers portal, "101 Recruitment", in 2013. Initially, the platform focused solely on job listings in web development where tech companies could post job listings and seek employees with fixed job criteria. Soon, it quickly expanded to include other related fields like Software Engineering, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. The founders brought on additional web developers, designers and staff to help manage the platform and provide top-notch service to their customers.</p>
